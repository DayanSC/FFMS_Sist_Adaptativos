The name of each file/instance is composed of the numbers N-M-I, where

- N is the number of input strings, i.e. |\Omega|;
- M is the length of each of the N input strings;
- I+26999 is the random seed used to generate the instance.

Each file contains N strings of length M and ends with '\n'

For each instance/file, it has been used the threshold t in {0.75M, 0.8M, 0.85M}.
